PHPAGI README
-------------

Welcome to PHPAGI.

phpagi is a set of PHP classes for use in developing applications with
the Asterisk Gateway Interface, and is licensed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (see COPYING for terms).

This release (version 3) of the phpagi classes is a significant overhaul
from the old version 1 and 2 library.  API functions have been renamed and
restructured.

Version 1 and 2 of phpagi is no longer supported, but will continue to be
available for historical purposes.  We strongly encourage you to migrate
to this new version.

If you have developed software based around phpagi, we'd like to hear from
you!  Drop us a note, and indicate whether you'd like us to list your
application on our website.
